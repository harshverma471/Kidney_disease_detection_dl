Chronic Kidney Disease Detection

Overview:
This repository contains a deep learning project aimed at detecting chronic kidney disease (CKD) from patient data with high accuracy. The model developed in this project achieves over 90% accuracy in classifying patients as either having CKD or not.

Dataset:
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of anonymized patient records, including various demographic, clinical, and laboratory features. Each record is labeled as either positive (CKD present) or negative (CKD absent).

Model Architecture:
The deep learning model utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, specifically designed to process tabular data efficiently. The model incorporates multiple layers of convolutional and pooling operations, followed by fully connected layers for classification.

Training and Evaluation:
The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to train and evaluate the model. The model is trained using gradient-based optimization techniques, with performance monitored on the validation set to prevent overfitting. Final evaluation is conducted on the test set to assess real-world performance.

Results:
The trained model achieves a classification accuracy of over 90% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately identifying CKD cases from patient data.
